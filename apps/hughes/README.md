# hughes (a carson OTP app)

Mrs. Hughes is the head of housekeeping and while she is considered by most
of the downstairs as a joint head of "the downstairs" of Downton Abbey in
partnership with Mr. Carson (the head butler), women weren't really given
equal footing in those days.

Without her Mr. Carson would be lost, this much is obvious.

## Responsibilities

The `hughes` OTP app will take care of the "housekeeping" activities related
to scheduling, managing, and triggering builds or deploys.

These are core responsibilities of the carson ecosystem and as such for the
purpose of better fault tolerance guarantees than popular CI tools used
today, which are *"designed"* around a shoddily built web application, these
functions will be based on replicated, coordinating, decentralized lighweight
processes.
