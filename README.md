# Carson

The real bulter. Jenkins and Hudson suck arse in comparison.

I am, of course, referring to the horrible excuses for CI servers (Jenkins
and Hudson).

## Overview

Carson's namesake is the butler from Downton Abbey. Yeah, I'm a freak who
watches British TV period dramas. Deal with it.

This project is an attempt to build a continuous delivery toolkit that can
be run on a cluster of decentralized nodes, removing the most common single
points of failure, the shared datastore and the typically disgusting hairball
of XML configuration files that need to be synced across master nodes.

Much more to come.

Yeah, I know boring, but pretty darn liberally licensed so hopefully that
works for you anyway.
